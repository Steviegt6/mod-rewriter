# Mod Rewriter
A .NET 6 library and console application for programmatically rewriting [_tModLoader_](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/) modifications. Useful for porting to and from the latest alpha 1.4 version.

Additionally, _Mod Rewriter_ supports loading additional assemblies which may provide their own rewriters.

This project takes heavy inspiration from Chik3r's [tModProter](https://github.com/Chik3r/tModPorter), and uses many similar concepts.
